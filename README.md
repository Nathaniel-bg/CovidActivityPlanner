Hackathon cuHacking:SnowedIn Covid Activity Planner

## Description

This application helps the user know which venue to go when going out during covid-19. The user simply inputs where they want to go and the area they are intererested to go. The application then lets the user know which venue is less busy live. The user can also choose a different time they would preffer to go (even a range), which using geospacial location data, allow the user to know the most likely to be less busy spot for them to go.

Once the application has computed the information, it will show the user the information gathered and will then recommend the user with the best location.
